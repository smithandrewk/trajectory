#  Welcome to the delta project.

## Introduction
We want to spatially reconstruct sensor data given by various mobile devices using no more than the following 3 sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer. There are countless applications for a spatial reconstruction of sensor data. Spatial reconstruction allows for _context_. Previously, mobile sensors could tell you how you are accelerating, gyrating, and magnetometing; however, with _context_, mobile sensors could describe how _and where_ you are accelerating, gyrating, and magnetometing.
