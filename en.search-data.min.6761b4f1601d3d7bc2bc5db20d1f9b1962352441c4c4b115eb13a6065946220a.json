In the future, we will consider position not to be fixed; however, we make this idealization to consider gyration first.\nBefore proceeding with a 3 dimensional mathematical process, let us consider an idealization in 2 dimensions.\n2 Dimensional Idealization #  Imagine you live in flatland,\na 2-dimensional land whererin you are a 1-dimensional creature (with a rigid-ish body).\nYou can rotate 20 degrees about the origin, labeled \u0026lsquo;O\u0026rsquo;, resulting in an orientation of 20 degrees counterclockwise about the origin.\nYou can also rotate 90 degrees, or pi/2 radians.\nSo, we can define your (or any rigid body\u0026rsquo;s) orientation by the angle rotated minus the initial angle.\nFormalism #  Let   \\(A\\)  be a rigid body centered at the origin in a 2 dimensional cartesian space. Define the initial orientation of the rigid body by the basis  \\[B = \\begin{bmatrix} i \u0026amp; j \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\]  shown in the following figure where i is red and j is green.\nThe resulting orientation after a rotation of  \\(\\theta\\)  radians can be described by the following rotation matrix:\nsee page on rotation matrices  \\[R = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta) \u0026amp; -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta) \u0026amp; \\cos(\\theta) \\end{bmatrix}.\\]  We obtain the new basis by\n \\[RB = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta) \u0026amp; -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta) \u0026amp; \\cos(\\theta) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}=R.\\]  Example #  Suppose  \\(\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\)  radians.
